# function
A function of code that can be executed by calling its name

It is best to name functions after verbs. Function are not executed until their name are called with paranthesis(). Writing the function name simply refrences the function itself.

Function can accept parameters (often called arguments). A parameter/argument is a data type or object that the function will operate on. Parameters/arguments are placed in the paranthasis when calling the function. Multiple arguments are seperated by a coma.

Even if a function takes no arguemnts you still have to write the parenthasis to execute it.

# variable
variable in Javascript are declared by using the let, var, or const keywords. The keywords you used determines the scope of the variable.
You can declare a varible without a keyword and it will be a global variable.

# objects
Objects have properties that can be accessed using dot(.) notation. When using dot notation you're requesting information or an action of that object. The part after the dot either a property of the obk=ject or a function. Example: document.write
